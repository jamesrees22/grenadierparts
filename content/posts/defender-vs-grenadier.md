title: "Ineos Grenadier vs Land Rover Defender: Which Suits Real Off-Road Use?"

excerpt: "Engineering differences that matter when you leave the tarmac."

The Grenadier leans toward utility with body-on-frame construction and solid axles, while the new Defender blends road manners and off-road capability with independent suspension and modern electronics.

**Consider:**
- Payload and roof ratings
- Approach/departure angles
- Accessory ecosystem (racks, protection, electrics)
- Maintenance access and field repairability

If you want maximal simplicity and field serviceability, the Grenadier edges it. If you want all-round comfort and tech, the Defender is brilliant.
