### 1. Ineos Hikes Prices As Trump‚Äôs Tariffs Hit US Consumers
<img src="https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IG002-1007rrrr.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;margin:6px 0 10px;border:1px solid #1e2937" />
The US administration's new auto tariffs are raising prices and Americans will foot the bill The fallout from President Trump‚Äôs tariffs continues to mount and automakers are scrambling to respond. Among them is Ineos Automotive, which is getting hammered by fees as the Grenadier and Quartermaster are made in Hambach, France.This means they‚Äôre subject to a 25% import tariff and prices are climbing as a result. However, Ineos is ‚Äúshielding‚Äù customers from paying the full cost.More: Ineos Outraged At EU Over Trump Tariffs, Says ‚ÄúThis Is What Happens When Politicians Sit On Their Hands‚ÄùSo what does this mean? Grenadier prices have climbed by 5% to start at $78,900. That‚Äôs a relatively small increase, especially compared to the Quartermaster pickup which is getting hit by a double whammy.As the company explained, the truck was already subject to the 25% chicken tax and now it‚Äôs being hit by another 25% tariff. In response, Ineos has hiked Quartermaster pricing by 10% as it now starts at $92,900.The price increases are alarming for Ineos as North America is their largest market and is responsible for more than 60% of their global sales. However, instead of blaming Trump, the company stra

The special Quartermaster is rocking a long-range, 168-liter fuel tank and an aluminum canopy This is the Ineos Grenadier Quartermaster Kaiju and it might just be the ultimate version of the Defender-inspired British pickup truck. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs only a one-off and has only been built to be used at various promotional events across Australia over the coming months.The special Grenadier Quartermaster gets its name from the Japanese word for ‚Äògiant creature‚Äô or ‚Äòmonster‚Äô. The truck has been modified with many accessories thanks to the company‚Äôs partnership with many leading 4√ó4 accessory suppliers, including Stedi, Norweld, Rhino-Rack, Redarc, JMACX, and BF Goodrich.Read: The Ineos Grenadier Didn‚Äôt Look Tough Enough, So CTC Fixed ThatNorweld was called on to design a custom tray and canopy for the Ineos. Made from lightweight aluminum, it includes a 40-liter (10.5-gallon) water tank, a 1,200 mm (47.2-inch) trundle drawer with a drop-in table, and a 2-Pac paint finish to ensure it can handle even the toughest environments. There‚Äôs also a 130-liter (34-gallon) Bushman fridge and a bolt-on jerry can holder, perfect for long adventures into the wilderness.Redarc has installed a 2000W

The Chelsea Truck Company's styling modifications were inspired by similar widebody kits available for the classic Defender Ineos may have rolled out an extensive customization program for the Grenadier, but that‚Äôs hardly going to deter the tuning crowd from working their magic. Enter the Chelsea Truck Company, which has taken a fresh pass at the off-roader, decking it out with a bespoke body kit that looks like it could withstand a battlefield, plus a reimagined interior featuring Nappa leather upholstery.The Ineos Grenadier Series II Expedition was inspired by the tuner‚Äôs widebody Land Rover Defenders. The exterior modifications are designed by Kahn, featuring a ‚Äú3D Military Textured Matte Black‚Äù finish that sets them apart from the rest of the creme-colored bodywork, together with exposed carbon fiber components.More: Mansory Gets Its Hands On The Ineos GrenadierThe Grenadier received bolt-on fender extensions, a new grille, a bulged hood with integrated LEDs, redesigned front and rear bumpers with larger intakes, a roof spoiler, and electronically-retractable side steps with illumination.The SUV rides on matte black 20-inch RS Forged deep concave wheels shod in 37-inch all-terr

The off-roader looks tougher and sportier, while benefiting from a luxurious leather-wrapped interior with a refrigerator at the back After customizing countless Mercedes G-Class and Land Rover Defender builds, Mansory has now turned its attention to the Ineos Grenadier, giving it a makeover that screams ‚Äúflashy.‚Äù The off-roader now sports a bodykit, a reupholstered cabin, and various chassis and performance upgrades.Starting with the exterior, Mansory‚Äôs Grenadier comes draped in carbon fiber accents that might make even a G63 AMG blush. At the front, you‚Äôll find a splitter paired with a grille and hood bulge flaunting the Mansory emblem. The wide fender extensions and rear bumper also get the carbon fiber treatment, complete with integrated vents.More: Ineos Shows Grenadier Concepts With Portal Axles And GM V8The visual upgrades continue with aerodynamic roof add-ons and an array of extra LEDs, sharply contrasting with the Grenadier Wagon‚Äôs white exterior. Another standout feature is the new 20-inch FV.9 alloy wheels, wrapped in 305/50 R20 XL tires for enhanced grip.While most Mansory-tuned vehicles sit closer to the ground compared to their stock equivalents, the Ineos Grenadier

According to Ineos, the diverse collection of prototypes could inspire future Grenadier variants Ineos went crazy at this year‚Äôs Goodwood Festival of Speed, bridging a lineup of heavily modified Grenadiers. The collection includes a Quartermaster pickup with portal axles, another pickup with a short-bed configuration, a V8-powered Station Wagon, an eight-seater Safari conversion, and an FIA-approved rally-spec build.Ineos wanted to showcase the versatility of the Ineos Grenadier platform with its prototypes and spark customer interest for future bespoke builds by the company‚Äôs Arcane Works personalization division. The company has just revealed the first limited-production series of the Grenadier, in the form of the luxurious Detour.More: Ineos Grenadier Detour Brings Luxury And Exclusivity To Rugged Off-RoaderThe most impressive builds are probably the Grenadier Quartermaster and Station Wagon with portal axles and larger off-road tires, created by German company LeTech. These come with a massive ground clearance of 514 mm (20.2 inches), a 250 mm (9.8 inches) increase compared to the standard Grenadier, and remind us of the Mercedes-AMG G63 4√ó4¬≤.The wading depth has been increased

Special edition of the off-roader adds a premium flair inside the cabin for a limited number of 200 units Ineos launched the first product of the newly established Arcane Works division, the Grenadier Detour. The model has a limited production of 200 units, with each owner having access to a wider color palette, bespoke details, a new exhaust system, and high-quality materials for the interior.The Ineos Grenadier Detour is visually distinguished from the standard Grenadier Station Wagon thanks to the new 18-inch forged alloy wheels and a different grille design. The company also added new colors for the skid plates, roof rails, and rear ladder, while decoloring the exterior lighting.More: Ineos Wants To Open More Dealerships In The U.S. And CanadaThe bodywork can be painted in four new color options ‚Äì Magma Red, Whiteout Blue, Storm Force Silver, and the pictured Squall Green ‚Äì which are polished by hand. If these are not special enough, owners can ask Arcane Works to match a color of their choice, effectively creating a one-off Grenadier.Moving inside, the Detour represents a significant step up from the spartan atmosphere of the standard Grenadier. There are four options of fine-

### 7. Ineos Says A Mix Of Powertrains Is Needed To Achieve Emissions Targets, Not Just EVs
<img src="https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ineois.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;margin:6px 0 10px;border:1px solid #1e2937" />
The car company will use several technologies, including ICE, hydrogen and EV powertrains More and more battery-electric off-roaders are hitting the market and with even the iconic Mercedes-Benz G-Class going electric, it seems inevitable that even more will follow suit. However, Ineos Automotive is echoing Toyota‚Äôs sentiment and believes that different powertrain technologies will be needed well into the future.The Ineos Grenadier is currently sold with BMW-sourced petrol and diesel engines but the marque is already dabbling in hydrogen fuel cell and battery-electric powertrains. While recently speaking at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany, Ineos Automotive chief executive Lynn Calder said combustion engines ‚Äúsuit‚Äù the Grenadier.Read: New Ineos Fusilier EV Is A Smaller SUV With Optional Range-Extender‚ÄúWe are not saying that electric vehicles do not have a place,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe very much believe that they do have a place. But I just do not see a scenario where 100 percent of powertrain requirements are fulfilled by electric.‚ÄùIneos has already previewed its first all-electric off-roader, dubbed the Fusilier. The new model will hit the market in 2026 and also be offered as a range e

The special edition Grenadier is painted in Magic Mushroom white and will be available in 1,924 units This is the first limited-edition variant of the Ineos Grenadier. While you may have expected a special Grenadier to be an even more capable off-roader than the standard model, the changes made are purely visual and celebrate the 100th anniversary of clothing brand Belstaff.The special model, dubbed the Grenadier 1924, will be available from June 26 and capped at just 1,924 units globally. All examples will feature the same exterior finish, combining Magic Mushroom (off-white) with Inky Black. While this isn‚Äôt the most dramatic of exterior finishes, it suits the Grenadier nicely.Read: Ineos Considering U.S. Factory, Sees Two More SUVs In Its FutureElsewhere, Ineos has equipped the limited-run model with gloss black diamond-cut 17-inch two-tone alloy wheels and a black front grille. The Grenadier also includes front and rear skid plates finished in dark grey.Modifications continue in the cabin where the dashboard, center stack, overhead console, switch gear, and console, all now have a dark green finish.

Ineos thinks the off-road focused Grenadier Quartermaster pickup could be a hit with American consumers The Ineos Grenadier off-roader may only be faintly familiar to American readers, but the automaker believes that the pickup truck version, the Grenadier Quartermaster, could be a hit with U.S. consumers, and may look to manufacture the model in the country.Currently, Ineos makes its vehicles at a former Mercedes facility in France, and is on track to sell about 30,000 units this year. But the company wants to grow, and part of that growth means looking for another production facility.Read: Ineos Grenadier Quartermaster Is A Pricey Pickup That Starts From $86,900Speaking at the Financial Times Future of the Car Summit in London, Ineos Automotive CEO Lynn Calder confirmed that the startup is ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù interested in opening a manufacturing plant in the U.S., reports Motor Trend. The young automaker is also looking at a facility in China, but admits that American duties on imported trucks may make that difficult.In addition to reaching new markets, Ineos also wants to reach new buyers by expanding its lineup.

### 10. Chelsea Truck Company Cheats On Defenders With New Ineos Grenadier Project
<img src="https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ineos-Grenadier-by-Chelsea-Truck-Company-main.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;margin:6px 0 10px;border:1px solid #1e2937" />
The spiritual successor of the classic Defender gets new larger wheels, and subtle exterior upgrades, but this is only the start It‚Äôs no secret that the Ineos Grenadier is heavily inspired by the original Land Rover Defender, so it‚Äôs only natural for UK-based tuner Chelsea Truck Company ‚Äì mostly known for modifying Land Rovers ‚Äì to start offering a series of upgrades for it. The tuner even promises ‚Äúdramatically-styled conversion packages‚Äù for the Grenadier in the coming months.The company has already worked on at least three examples of the Grenadier, adding new wheels, subtle exterior upgrades, and an overhauled interior. Their coolest build yet is the pictured Ineos Grenadier Station Wagon finished in the stock Sela Green shade.More: New Ineos Grenadier Chassis Cab Is A Blank Canvas To Unleash Your CreativityThe SUV rides on a new set of 20-inch Mondial RS Forged alloy wheels shod in 35-inch tires, true to the off-road nature of the Grenadier. The only other aftermarket parts on the exterior are the gloss black spare wheel cover mounted on the tailgate, and the slightly modified wheel arches allowing the fitment of larger tires. However, the other Grenadier builds featured a Dak
