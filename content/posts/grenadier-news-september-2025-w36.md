Sticky door buttons don't allow the door to fully close, prompting another recall for Ineos Ineos is recalling more than 7,000 vehicles in the United States because of a door latch mechanism that could cause the door to swing open while in motion. That could be dangerous to occupants and other road users and will require impacted models to be returned to dealers.The British brand says the door button mechanism on 2024 Grenadier models may have been assembled with not enough grease. This means the exterior door buttons may remain in the depressed position, preventing the door from fully latching. If this happens, the door could randomly open.Read: The Ineos Grenadier Kaiju Is One Mean Pickup That‚Äôll Never Hit Your DrivewayImpacted Grenadiers were manufactured between July 6, 2023, and April 19, 2024. Owners experiencing the issue may notice door buttons getting stuck and observe a different sound when closing the door because it‚Äôs not fully engaging with the striker. A warning will also appear on the dashboard, confirming if a door is not fully closed.Ineos first became aware of several warranty claims for exterior door buttons that were sticking when doors opened from the outside i

The special Quartermaster is rocking a long-range, 168-liter fuel tank and an aluminum canopy This is the Ineos Grenadier Quartermaster Kaiju and it might just be the ultimate version of the Defender-inspired British pickup truck. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs only a one-off and has only been built to be used at various promotional events across Australia over the coming months.The special Grenadier Quartermaster gets its name from the Japanese word for ‚Äògiant creature‚Äô or ‚Äòmonster‚Äô. The truck has been modified with many accessories thanks to the company‚Äôs partnership with many leading 4√ó4 accessory suppliers, including Stedi, Norweld, Rhino-Rack, Redarc, JMACX, and BF Goodrich.Read: The Ineos Grenadier Didn‚Äôt Look Tough Enough, So CTC Fixed ThatNorweld was called on to design a custom tray and canopy for the Ineos. Made from lightweight aluminum, it includes a 40-liter (10.5-gallon) water tank, a 1,200 mm (47.2-inch) trundle drawer with a drop-in table, and a 2-Pac paint finish to ensure it can handle even the toughest environments. There‚Äôs also a 130-liter (34-gallon) Bushman fridge and a bolt-on jerry can holder, perfect for long adventures into the wilderness.Redarc has installed a 2000W

The Chelsea Truck Company's styling modifications were inspired by similar widebody kits available for the classic Defender Ineos may have rolled out an extensive customization program for the Grenadier, but that‚Äôs hardly going to deter the tuning crowd from working their magic. Enter the Chelsea Truck Company, which has taken a fresh pass at the off-roader, decking it out with a bespoke body kit that looks like it could withstand a battlefield, plus a reimagined interior featuring Nappa leather upholstery.The Ineos Grenadier Series II Expedition was inspired by the tuner‚Äôs widebody Land Rover Defenders. The exterior modifications are designed by Kahn, featuring a ‚Äú3D Military Textured Matte Black‚Äù finish that sets them apart from the rest of the creme-colored bodywork, together with exposed carbon fiber components.More: Mansory Gets Its Hands On The Ineos GrenadierThe Grenadier received bolt-on fender extensions, a new grille, a bulged hood with integrated LEDs, redesigned front and rear bumpers with larger intakes, a roof spoiler, and electronically-retractable side steps with illumination.The SUV rides on matte black 20-inch RS Forged deep concave wheels shod in 37-inch all-terr

The off-roader looks tougher and sportier, while benefiting from a luxurious leather-wrapped interior with a refrigerator at the back After customizing countless Mercedes G-Class and Land Rover Defender builds, Mansory has now turned its attention to the Ineos Grenadier, giving it a makeover that screams ‚Äúflashy.‚Äù The off-roader now sports a bodykit, a reupholstered cabin, and various chassis and performance upgrades.Starting with the exterior, Mansory‚Äôs Grenadier comes draped in carbon fiber accents that might make even a G63 AMG blush. At the front, you‚Äôll find a splitter paired with a grille and hood bulge flaunting the Mansory emblem. The wide fender extensions and rear bumper also get the carbon fiber treatment, complete with integrated vents.More: Ineos Shows Grenadier Concepts With Portal Axles And GM V8The visual upgrades continue with aerodynamic roof add-ons and an array of extra LEDs, sharply contrasting with the Grenadier Wagon‚Äôs white exterior.

The model has a limited production of 200 units, with each owner having access to a wider color palette, bespoke details, a new exhaust system, and high-quality materials for the interior.The Ineos Grenadier Detour is visually distinguished from the standard Grenadier Station Wagon thanks to the new 18-inch forged alloy wheels and a different grille design.

The special edition Grenadier is painted in Magic Mushroom white and will be available in 1,924 units This is the first limited-edition variant of the Ineos Grenadier. While you may have expected a special Grenadier to be an even more capable off-roader than the standard model, the changes made are purely visual and celebrate the 100th anniversary of clothing brand Belstaff.The special model, dubbed the Grenadier 1924, will be available from June 26 and capped at just 1,924 units globally.

The spiritual successor of the classic Defender gets new larger wheels, and subtle exterior upgrades, but this is only the start It‚Äôs no secret that the Ineos Grenadier is heavily inspired by the original Land Rover Defender, so it‚Äôs only natural for UK-based tuner Chelsea Truck Company ‚Äì mostly known for modifying Land Rovers ‚Äì to start offering a series of upgrades for it. The tuner even promises ‚Äúdramatically-styled conversion packages‚Äù for the Grenadier in the coming months.The company has already worked on at least three examples of the Grenadier, adding new wheels, subtle exterior upgrades, and an overhauled interior. Their coolest build yet is the pictured Ineos Grenadier Station Wagon finished in the stock Sela Green shade.More: New Ineos Grenadier Chassis Cab Is A Blank Canvas To Unleash Your CreativityThe SUV rides on a new set of 20-inch Mondial RS Forged alloy wheels shod in 35-inch tires, true to the off-road nature of the Grenadier.

However, the other Grenadier builds featured a Dak
