Ineos has put its wild Grenadier concept into production following an enthusiastic response from its customers For drivers who demand more than just off-road competence, the latest version of the Ineos Grenadier arrives with a serious set of upgrades, and a price tag to match. With increased ground clearance, portal axles, and a full suite of rugged accessories, this upgraded model is designed for truly demanding terrain. The overhaul is carried out by German specialist Letech, resulting in a vehicle built to handle conditions few others can.The idea started with a beefed-up Grenadier concept that debuted at the Goodwood Festival of Speed last year. Following an enthusiastic response from customers with over 1,000 registrations of interest and “numerous from rescue services, aid agencies and other commercial fleets operating vehicles in extreme environments”, Ineos and Letech decided to offer a production version.When Being Good Ain’t Good EnoughThe original concept was based on the Quartermaster pickup, but the same treatment has now been applied to the Grenadier Station Wagon. The highlight is the heavy-duty five-link front and rear suspension with portal axles and offset wheel h

### 2. Why Overpay For A New Grenadier When A Nearly-New One Saves You Tens Of Thousands?

Search around for a Grenadier and you may be able to find yourself a bargain Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire behind the Ineos chemicals empire, deserves recognition for his ambitious foray into the automotive world. Following the announcement that Jaguar Land Rover would discontinue the original Defender, Ratcliffe set out to create a worthy successor, ultimately launching production of the Grenadier in late 2022. Read: Ineos Hikes Prices As Trump’s Tariffs Hit US ConsumersFor shoppers who don’t want something like a new Defender or a Mercedes-Benz G-Class, the Grenadier offers a compelling choice.A Shrewd Alternative in the Used MarketHowever, buying one new might not be the best option as depreciation makes lightly used examples significantly more affordable. Earlier this month, a 2024 Grenadier Trailmaster Edition traded hands for $64,500 with just 760 miles (1,234 kilometers) on the clock on Bring a Trailer. While that’s pricier than the most basic Land Rover Defender 110 available, it represents a near-$20,000 loss from this model’s original price tag of $84,320.There’s no word on why the original owner has parted ways with the off-roader so soon, but the winning bidder loo

The US administration's new auto tariffs are raising prices and Americans will foot the bill The fallout from President Trump’s tariffs continues to mount and automakers are scrambling to respond. Among them is Ineos Automotive, which is getting hammered by fees as the Grenadier and Quartermaster are made in Hambach, France.This means they’re subject to a 25% import tariff and prices are climbing as a result. However, Ineos is “shielding” customers from paying the full cost.More: Ineos Outraged At EU Over Trump Tariffs, Says “This Is What Happens When Politicians Sit On Their Hands”So what does this mean? Grenadier prices have climbed by 5% to start at $78,900. That’s a relatively small increase, especially compared to the Quartermaster pickup which is getting hit by a double whammy.As the company explained, the truck was already subject to the 25% chicken tax and now it’s being hit by another 25% tariff. In response, Ineos has hiked Quartermaster pricing by 10% as it now starts at $92,900.The price increases are alarming for Ineos as North America is their largest market and is responsible for more than 60% of their global sales. However, instead of blaming Trump, the company stra

The car manufacturer hasn't named the supplier that's forced it to halt production Ineos has been forced to pause production of the Grenadier and Quartermaster at its factory in Hambach, France, due to issues at one of its important suppliers. While no exact date has been given as to when production could resume, the plant is expected to sit idle for several months.The official word from the British car manufacturer is that the supplier of a “trim part” is in financial trouble and that neither the Grenadier nor Quartermaster can be sold without this part.Read: Mansory Gets Its Hands On The Ineos Grenadier“The supplier is in a pre-insolvency situation,” Ineos Automotive chief executive Lynn Carter told Auto News. “It’s a trim part but one that we can’t sell the car without. I know that the [supplier] is working really hard to try and turn around their business and I want to give them every opportunity to do that.”While Ineos has not named the supplier, some believe it is Recaro. The world-famous seat supplier filed for bankruptcy at the end of July and is known to supply Ineos with its seats. Carter noted the brand is seeking out a secondary supplier for the unspecified component, a

The carmaker expects the Grenadier SUV to outsell the Quartermaster pickup by 4:1 or even 5:1 Ineos wants to grow its retail presence across North America to bump up sales in the U.S. and Canada for the Grenadier SUV and the Grenadier Quartermaster pickup truck.The British company currently operates 18 dealerships in 14 U.S. states and has two dealers in Canada. Greg Clark, the executive vice president for Ineos in the Americas, says the automaker is looking to add five to six dealerships this year and is particularly keen to expand into the Phoenix metro area and greater Washington D.C. It also wants to grow in the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut areas.Read: Ineos Says A Mix Of Powertrains Is Needed To Achieve Emissions Targets, Not Just EVsWhile speaking with Auto News, Clark added that the Midwest is also a focus for the firm as it currently has just a single dealership in the region, located in Lake Bluff, Illinois. Ineos is also targeting Calgary and Edmonton for its expansion before the firm touches down in Mexico towards the end of this year.U.S. deliveries of the Grenadier started around Thanksgiving, and in the ensuing months, the car manufacturer has delivered rough

### 6. Ineos Says A Mix Of Powertrains Is Needed To Achieve Emissions Targets, Not Just EVs
<img src="https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ineois.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;margin:6px 0 10px;border:1px solid #1e2937" />
The car company will use several technologies, including ICE, hydrogen and EV powertrains More and more battery-electric off-roaders are hitting the market and with even the iconic Mercedes-Benz G-Class going electric, it seems inevitable that even more will follow suit. However, Ineos Automotive is echoing Toyota’s sentiment and believes that different powertrain technologies will be needed well into the future.The Ineos Grenadier is currently sold with BMW-sourced petrol and diesel engines but the marque is already dabbling in hydrogen fuel cell and battery-electric powertrains. While recently speaking at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany, Ineos Automotive chief executive Lynn Calder said combustion engines “suit” the Grenadier.Read: New Ineos Fusilier EV Is A Smaller SUV With Optional Range-Extender“We are not saying that electric vehicles do not have a place,” she said. “We very much believe that they do have a place. But I just do not see a scenario where 100 percent of powertrain requirements are fulfilled by electric.”Ineos has already previewed its first all-electric off-roader, dubbed the Fusilier. The new model will hit the market in 2026 and also be offered as a range e

Ineos thinks the off-road focused Grenadier Quartermaster pickup could be a hit with American consumers The Ineos Grenadier off-roader may only be faintly familiar to American readers, but the automaker believes that the pickup truck version, the Grenadier Quartermaster, could be a hit with U.S. consumers, and may look to manufacture the model in the country.Currently, Ineos makes its vehicles at a former Mercedes facility in France, and is on track to sell about 30,000 units this year. But the company wants to grow, and part of that growth means looking for another production facility.Read: Ineos Grenadier Quartermaster Is A Pricey Pickup That Starts From $86,900Speaking at the Financial Times Future of the Car Summit in London, Ineos Automotive CEO Lynn Calder confirmed that the startup is “absolutely” interested in opening a manufacturing plant in the U.S., reports Motor Trend. The young automaker is also looking at a facility in China, but admits that American duties on imported trucks may make that difficult.In addition to reaching new markets, Ineos also wants to reach new buyers by expanding its lineup.

Last year, Ineos showcased an even more rugged version of the Grenadier, a prototype with portal axles. Now, the company has announced it is putting the vehicle into production with the help of Letech, the German off-road aftermarket specialist and builder.The upgrade adds a heavy-duty five-link front and rear suspension, portal axles with offset wheel hubs, and 37-inch BF Goodrich Mud Terrain off-road tires to the Grenadier and Grenadier Quartermaster Trialmasters. The tires wrap around 18-inch Hutchinson Industries forged beadlock alloy wheels.The portal axle modification increases the Grenadier’s ground clearance by 7.3 inches, to 17.7 inches. It also increases the vehicle’s wading depth to 41.3 inches, up from 31.5. Ineos says the upgrade gives the Grenadier greater wheel travel, better axle articulation, and a wider footprint.Letech also adds a tire pressure control system, high-performance brakes, a front winch system, and a spare wheel carrier. Visual upgrades include extended wheel arches, off-road running boards, a multi-function rear ladder with a

Matt Scott interviews Scott Brady on his first drive of the (prototype) Grenadier Trialmaster SUV from Ineos. The Grenadier represents a significant offering to the overland market, being the first build on purpose SUV for overlanding in several years (since the 200 TLC left the market). The Grenadier combines classic styling with body on frame construction, 5-link suspension, solid axles, and three differential locks. The Grenadier strikes the balance of capacity (payload at 1,900 pounds), capability, durability, and overall suitability for travel. The Overland Journal Podcast features the travelers, topics, and news related to the overlanding community and industry. This podcast is hosted by Scott Brady, Ashley Giordano, and Matt Scott. This podcast is a production of the Overland Journal Magazine and the expeditionportal.com website.
