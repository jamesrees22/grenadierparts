The Ineos Grenadier is engineered to be a tough, reliable workhorse. But like any serious 4x4, regular maintenance is the key to keeping it performing at its best â€” whether youâ€™re tackling trails, towing heavy loads, or just using it as a daily driver.  

This guide covers service intervals, common checks, and maintenance tips for Grenadier owners in 2025.

## Service Intervals (UK 2025 guidance)

- **Oil & filter change:** every 12 months or 10,000 miles (whichever comes first).  
- **Brake fluid:** every 2 years.  
- **Coolant:** every 4 years.  
- **Air filter:** inspect annually, replace every 2 years (more often if used in dusty/off-road conditions).  
- **Fuel filter (diesel models):** replace every 2 years.  
- **Transmission & transfer case fluid:** check every 2 years, replace every 6 years.  
- **Differential oil:** inspect at 2 years, replace at 4 years.  
- **Spark plugs (petrol models):** replace every 4 years or 40,000 miles.  

> Always check your official service handbook, as intervals may vary with driving conditions.

## DIY Checks Between Services

- **Tyre pressure & tread:**  
  Off-road use wears tyres fast. Keep them inflated to spec, and rotate every 6,000 miles.  

- **Engine oil level:**  
  Check monthly, more often if towing or off-roading.  

- **Brake pads & discs:**  
  Heavy use (towing, off-road descents) can shorten life. Listen for squeal or grinding.  

- **Battery & electrics:**  
  Modern 4x4s have a lot of electronics. Check for corrosion on terminals and test voltage.  

- **Fluid leaks:**  
  Look under the vehicle for oil or coolant drips, especially after rough terrain.

## Grenadier-Specific Tips

- **Solid axles & propshafts:**  
  Grease the propshaft U-joints regularly if you use the vehicle off-road.  

- **Underbody protection:**  
  Inspect skid plates for damage after heavy trail use. Replace if bent or cracked.  

- **Snorkel users:**  
  If fitted, check seals after deep-water crossings.  

- **Locking differentials:**  
  Engage occasionally even if not needed â€” it keeps actuators lubricated and working.

## Servicing Costs (UK, 2025 estimates)

- **Minor service:** Â£250â€“Â£350  
- **Major service (fluids, filters, plugs):** Â£600â€“Â£900  
- **Brake pads & discs (all round):** Â£500â€“Â£800  
- **Tyre replacement (set of 5 all-terrain tyres):** Â£1,000â€“Â£1,500  

Independent 4x4 specialists may be cheaper than main dealers, but always ensure they use approved fluids and parts.

## Extended Warranty & Service Plans

INEOS offers extended service plans in some markets. These can make sense if:  
- You cover high annual mileage.  
- You use the Grenadier for heavy towing or commercial work.  
- You want predictable maintenance costs.

## Essential Maintenance Accessories

- **OBD-II scanner:** great for reading error codes and clearing simple warnings.  
- **Workshop manual:** invaluable for DIY jobs.  
- **Quality tool kit:** sockets, torque wrench, breaker bar.  
- **Grease gun:** to maintain suspension and driveline components.
