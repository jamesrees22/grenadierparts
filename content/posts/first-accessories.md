If you're setting up a Grenadier for travel or trails, start with these categories:

1. **Roof rack** – modular platforms like Front Runner/Rhino-Rack.
2. **Recovery kit** – shackles, snatch strap, traction boards.
3. **Lighting** – quality LED bar or ditch lights.
4. **Tyres** – all-terrain with strong sidewalls.
5. **Comms & nav** – offline maps, GMRS/PMR radios.

> Tip: choose accessories that keep weight low and centred. Overloading a high roof rack hurts handling.
