The Ineos Grenadier is already a go-anywhere 4x4. But with the right gear, it can also become a comfortable rolling campsite â€” perfect for extended trips, wild camping, or cross-continental expeditions.  

Hereâ€™s how to set up your Grenadier for overlanding and camping in 2025.

## Roof-Top Tent (RTT)
A roof-top tent keeps you off the ground, away from mud, and safe from wildlife. The Grenadierâ€™s strong roof load rating makes it ideal for RTTs.

## Awnings & Shelter
An awning provides instant shade and rain protection. Side-mounted 270Â° awnings are especially useful for creating outdoor living space.

## Fridge/Freezer
Forget ice boxes. A 12V fridge/freezer keeps food and drinks cold for days. Pair it with a dual-battery setup or portable power station.

## Dual-Battery & Power Solutions
Running lights, fridges, and devices off your starter battery is risky. A dedicated auxiliary battery or portable power station ensures reliable power.

## Drawer Systems & Storage
Organisation is key. Drawer systems keep tools, cooking gear, and recovery equipment accessible and rattle-free.

## Cooking Gear
Compact gas stoves, portable BBQs, or all-in-one cooking systems make meal prep quick and easy. Add collapsible cookware to save space.

## Recovery Gear
Even with a winch, youâ€™ll want essentials like recovery boards, a high-lift jack, and a shovel.

## Lighting & Camp Setup
LED work lights or camp lanterns extend your evenings outdoors. Consider wiring exterior scene lights directly into the Grenadier.

## Water Storage & Filtration
A jerry can, onboard tank, or water bladder ensures you have clean water. Pair it with a portable filter for extended trips.

## Heating & Comfort
For colder climates, a diesel heater (plumbed into the vehicleâ€™s tank) or portable propane heater keeps nights comfortable.
