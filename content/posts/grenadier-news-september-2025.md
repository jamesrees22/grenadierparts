## 🌍 Grenadier Community Events
Grenadier owner clubs are organising overlanding events across the UK and Europe this autumn. Highlights include:  
- Scotland Highland Expedition — October 2025  
- Pyrenees Overland Meet — November 2025  
- Midlands Winter Off-Road Rally — December 2025

## 🔋 Electrification Rumours
There are fresh rumours about an upcoming plug-in hybrid Grenadier. Industry insiders suggest INEOS is testing prototypes with BMW’s hybrid drivetrain. No official word yet, but announcements could come in early 2026.

---

## 📈 Resale Values Holding Strong
Used Grenadiers are holding their value well in the UK. Early 2022–2023 builds are still fetching close to original list prices, reflecting strong demand and limited supply. This makes the Grenadier one of the more “safe bet” vehicles in the 4x4 market.  

---

## Final Thoughts
The Grenadier continues to grow its reputation — not just as a rugged off-roader, but as a platform for customisation and community. With new trims, aftermarket growth, and strong resale values, it’s clear that the Grenadier is here to stay.  

Stay tuned for the next roundup in October 2025.
